        Welcome to my personal portfolio website. Here at my site I will share my background,
        skills, and projects related to information technology and web development.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am currently studying Computer Information Technology and will graduate at the end of this Spring and enjoy learning how
        structured and well planned systems support real world solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I continue developing this site, I will be adding project examples,
        technical skills, and contact information.
